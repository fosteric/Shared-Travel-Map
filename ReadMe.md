##Description:

Shared Travel Map is an app that allows travelers to share their past and present trips and
plan future trips with friends. Travelers simply pin previous and aspired travel destinations
on a map, to create a view of their travel history and goals. Once created, travelers can connect
with their friends to get a view of their friend's travel. For friends of choice, travelers
can create a shared view that allows them to see common destinations and send comments to
plan for a future trip. Once planning begins, a shared experience destination can be created
for the new trip and planning can begin!
